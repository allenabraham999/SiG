### What Is Regression?
***Regression*** analysis consists of a set of machine learning methods that allow us to predict
a continuous outcome variable (y) based on the value of one or multiple predictor variables
(x). Briefly, the goal of a regression model is to build a mathematical equation that defines y
as a function of the x variables. There are two types of regression, linear and logistics.

***Linear Regression*** is the oldest, simple, and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm for
predictive analysis.

### Regression Use Cases
- Prediction (E.g.: Predicting Real Estate Prices.)
- Forecasting (E.g.: Predicting demand for goods and services).

### Linear Regression Algorithm
&emsp;Let’s take a look at what goes under the hood and have a rough idea of what the
algorithm does before jumping into the code.

The ***Simple Linear Regression Model*** attempts to model the relation between two
variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an
independent variable while the other is considered to be a dependent variable

Here, talking about the graph, the equation of the line can generally, be taken as <br>
&emsp;y = m x + c <br>
where y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable

m here is the slope of the line and c is intercept (here at the y axis), <br>

Linear Regression intends to find out the best values for m and c to fit the best possible line
in the graph, by finding the optimal values for m and c here. There are multiple ways of
finding the best fit line, a common one is using the least-squares method. Here the goal is to
fit a line in which vertical distance between the data points and the line is minimum.
